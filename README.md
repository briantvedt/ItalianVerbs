# ItalianVerbs

Rules-based conjugation of Italian verbs.

# Goal

The goal is to derive all the inflected forms of a given verb from a limited
set of rules, with a manageable number of exceptions.

The code should be as readable as possible, with the hope that the rules
can be fully grasped, and even memorized, with sufficient study by a human
language learner.

# Code

The core is written in Standard ML. The test harness makes use of the SML/NJ
Library.

# Limitations

This project is still in its earliest stage, and currently only regular verbs,
and only some of their tenses, are supported.
